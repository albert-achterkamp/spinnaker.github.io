| **try.spinnaker.io**<br /><br />One of the best ways to learn Spinnaker is to use Spinnaker. This project is focused on generating  (and destroying) temporary sandbox environments for new users to play around with, hosted by spinnaker.io.<br /><br />**Available Mentor(s):** Fernando Freire, Dan Johnston  | Java<br />AWS Infrastructure |
| **Gamifying Spinnaker**<br /><br />Gamifying is more than just giving users a pat on the back. It can influence good behavior and set guidance towards learning new skills. Companies could also use this data to find experienced users within their organizations. While the sky is the limit, letâ€™s find what mechanics inspire you and bring that to life in Spinnaker!<br />**Available Mentor(s):** Dan Johnston, Fernando Freire | Javascript<br />Java |
| **Build-a-Plugin**<br /><br />Make a plugin to integrate Spinnaker with your favorite service / tool! Learn about Spinnaker and its Plugin Framework by creating a plugin for Spinnaker. Once the plugin is built, we will work together to add the plugin into the OSS Spinnaker Plugin Repository.<br /><br />**Available Mentor(s):** Cameron Motevasselani, Dan Johnston | Java<br />Javascript (if frontend is required) |
| **Release Improvement**<br /><br />Possible projects could include showing code coverage for projects, "X days since last deploy failure" signs and more!<br /><br />**Available Mentors:** Cameron Motevasselani, Fernando Freire | Java<br />Github Actions<br />Testing frameworks |
| **Mobile-first Spinnaker Experience**<br /><br />Build a mobile-first Spinnaker experience that gives users a quick and easy way to get at-a-glance intelligence about their cloud infrastructure, with easy hooks for taking the most common CD actions on the go.<br /><br />**Available Mentors:** Fernando Freire, Dan Johnston | (All Optional)<br />Javascript/ReactNative<br />Flutter<br />Java/Kotlin<br />ObjectiveC/Swift
